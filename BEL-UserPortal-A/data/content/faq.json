    "question": "How are my Rebate Rewards determined?",
    "answer": "We have designed a completely transparent rebate reward calculation mechanism to ensure that every effort you make receives precise rewards. All amounts are ultimately based in US dollars (USD). If the original currency of the order is not US dollars, the conversion rate will be based on the company's regulations at the time:\n\n• Order Amount: The total order amount when the customer places an order, converted to US dollars according to the exchange rate at the time.\n• Product Actual Amount: This is the basis for calculating rebate rewards. The calculation method is \"Order Amount\" minus all additional costs, including discounts, taxes, and shipping fees.\n• Gross Payout: \"Product Actual Amount\" multiplied by your current \"BEL level corresponding reward percentage.\"\n• Net Payout: After deducting 20% statutory withholding tax (WHT) from the \"Gross Amount,\" this is the final amount you actually receive.",

    "question": "What is the procedure if a customer returns a product?",

Should a customer return a product within the designated cooling-off period, the transaction is considered invalid, and the associated reward is voided. Only successful, non-refunded transactions are eligible for rewards. Your dashboard provides a real-time, accurate status of all transactions.",
